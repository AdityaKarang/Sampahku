Capstone Project Bangkit

We use kotlin native language to create the apps, firebase to user authentication like register and login and retrofit to call the API that was made by Cloud Computing team to implement machine learning model in scan waste feature. 
But we have a problem calling the API using retrofit so we call the model of machine learning directly in java class that the model use TFLite.
